# two sample testing The two-sample t-test (also known as the independent samples t-test) is a method used to test whether the unknown population means of two groups are equal or not.
import numpy as np 
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind #Importing Library
np.random.seed(42) 
sample1 = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100) #data group 1
sample2 = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100) #data group 2
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(sample1, sample2) # conduct testing 
print("t-value: ", t_stat) 
print("p-value: ", p_value)

# Two sample t-test has the following hypothesis:
H0 => µ1 = µ2 (population mean of dataset1 is equal to dataset2)
HA => µ1 ≠µ2 (population mean of dataset1 is different from dataset2)
# If the p-value is greater than the alpha =0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

#If you want to visualize the result in a histogram, then:
fig, ((ax1)) = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 1)
hist1 = sns.histplot(ax = ax1, x = , label = "")
hist2 = sns.histplot(ax = ax1, x = , label = "")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
