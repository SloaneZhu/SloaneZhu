#Simple linear regression using sklearn
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# This is an example where we investigate the relationship between the amount of trees in a certain region and their average height.
x = np.array([5, 7, 11, 4, 3, 20]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([23, 21, 18, 17, 22, 38])

#Time to create a model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)
model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y)

#Get the result
r_sq = model.score(x, y)
print(f"coefficient of determination: {r_sq}")
>>> coefficient of determination: 0.6474122786415519

#Print the result
print(f"intercept: {model.intercept_}")
>>> intercept: 15.147540983606556

print(f"slope: {model.coef_}")
>>> slope: [0.96229508]

# Seems there is a strong positive correlation between the amount of trees and their average height. More trees in a region, higher the trees are, probably due to biodiversity and a more complex biomass base.

# Now we can make predictions for new data
x_new = np.arange(5).reshape((-1, 1))
y_pred = model.predict(x_new)
print(f"predicted response:\n{y_pred}")
